# OnlineBook-to-PDF
I made this for myself so I could transfer my online class books into PDFs so I could work in them easier and keep my school work more organized.

## How to use
- Via the js console get all image links the online book gives you
- Paste the mess of links into the links.txt
- Run the clean.py, it will orden the links and but 1 link on each line
- Paste the ordened links into the bulk site opener (link in clean.py)
- Now use any img to PDF website (link in clean.py)
- now enjoy your PDF
